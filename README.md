# Learn about WSGI

1. [Introducing WSGI: Python’s Secret Web Weapon](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/09/27/introducing-wsgi-pythons-secret-web-weapon.html) and [Introducing WSGI: Python’s Secret Web Weapon, Part Two](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/10/04/introducing-wsgi-pythons-secret-web-weapon-part-two.html) by James Gardner are the best introductions to WSGI.
2. [WSGI Tutorial](http://wsgi.tutorial.codepoint.net/intro) by Clodoaldo Neto is another good tutorial. [The python codes](demo_code) shown in this tutorial are modified to run in Python 3.7.7+.
3. [PEP 333 -- Python Web Server Gateway Interface v1.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/)
4. [WSGI and the Pluggable Pipe Dream](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/27/the-pluggable-pipedream/) provides in-depth coverage of many of WSGI’s dark corners and design decisions that are not widely understood by people who weren’t involved in the original design, or who haven’t spent a lot of time working with it.
